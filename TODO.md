## Must Haves
- Animation specific duty
- Adrenaline simulation - more energy in panic situations
- Eden integration
- HUD indicator of anaerobic fatigue
- Documentation of all influences
- Combat Stance penalty dependant on weapon weight

## May Haves
- Tweak slow-jog speed to have better intermediate speed between jogging and walking
- Low chance of stumbling, dependant on current exhaustion
- Terrain surface influence
  - Stumbling chance increased in forests
  - Increased energy usage in some areas (which ones?)
- Temperature influence
- Modules or Eden setting for unit or group specific VO2max
- Barebones simulation for AI
